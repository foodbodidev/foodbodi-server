This document is to guide to partners who are going to help Foodbodi to collect data manually

1. For each restaurant, please create a separate file. This file must ends with ".json".
- For example, if your restaurant's name is GoodRestaurant, you should create a file name good_restaurant.json.

2. Open that file, copy below code and paste to it. See sample.json for example
{
  "name" : "Restaurant name",
  "address" : [
    "Address 1",
    "Address 2"
  ],
  "open_hour" : "8:00",
  "close_hour" : "21:00",
  "type" : "RESTAURANT",
  "category" : "FAST_FOOD",
